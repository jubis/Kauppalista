			<p>Welcome to <span class="bold">Kauppalista</span>. This is a simple web application that you can
			use as a shopping list - or actuelly, I think it does it also as a
			todo list or any list you want it to be.</p>
			<p>Checking items done and removing them one by one or all at once is easy and practical.
			Also the adding is simple and fun.</p>
			<p>Don't have profile yet? <%= link_to 'Sign up', '/signup' %></p>
			<p>Bye the way: if you have a Windows Phone, I'am creating a <span class="bold">WP dedicated version</span> too.</p>
